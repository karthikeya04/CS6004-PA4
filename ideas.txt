Ideas for testcases:

* Scalar replacement also reduces memory usage(header's gone). Maybe create thousands of scalar replacable objects
* Have many virtual methods in a class => virtual invoke becomes very costly => can easily show perf improvement by method inlining
* Assumed constructors to be simple (no object args, no method calls, no side effects)










Simplifying assumptions:
* not considering arrays
